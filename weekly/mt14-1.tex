\section{MT14 -- Week 1}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Implement measure and conditional measure tests to test the ERPs.
	\item Research continuous integration (Jenkins, etc.)
	\item Study Dirichlet processes
	\item Research stuff
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Improve RDB by sampling from ?? half of the time instead of sampling from the prior.
			\item Sample ERPs (?) in a discretised manner in order to cover more of the sample space.
		\end{itemize}
